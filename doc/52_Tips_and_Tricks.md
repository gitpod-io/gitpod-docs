# Tips & Tricks

Below you find a list of tips and tricks to the most useful tools.

## Command Palette

The command palette is the center for a keyboard-centric interaction as well as for looking up available commands and keybindings. It is available through the following two keybindings:
 - <kbd>F1</kbd> 
 - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS)

### The Command Palette is Contextual

The **Command Palette** contains all commands that are available from the application. Many of the accessible commands are context dependent. 
That means only those commands are visible that are active at the moment. For example, the `Go To Line...` command is only available when a code editor is opened and has focus.

## Color Themes

Gitpod opens in its **dark theme**. If you prefer a lighter experience, you can switch to the light theme.
Simply use the command palette and choose **Change Color Theme**.

## Open File

To quickly open any file using the keyboard, press
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS)

It will let you quickly search, find and open any file by name.

## Search in Workspace

To search for or replace string occurences in all files of your workspace press:
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS)

It opens the search view, which is described in more detail [here](56_Search.md).
